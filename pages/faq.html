                <div class="faq-question">What exactly happens during a listening session?</div>
                <div class="faq-answer">
                    <p>During a listening session, you'll have a dedicated space to express whatever is on your mind without interruption or judgment. The session begins with a brief welcome to help you settle in. Then, you lead the conversation, sharing whatever you'd like to discuss.</p>
                    <p>I'll listen attentively, occasionally reflecting back what I'm hearing to help deepen your awareness and provide the experience of being truly understood. Unlike therapy or coaching, there's no agenda, diagnosis, or advice-giving. The focus is entirely on creating space for you to process your thoughts and feelings through the act of expressing them.</p>
                    <p>We'll end with a brief closure to acknowledge what was shared and help you transition back to your day.</p>

                <div class="faq-question">How is this different from therapy?</div>
                <div class="faq-answer">
                    <p>While both therapy and our listening services provide space for emotional expression, there are important differences:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Purpose:</strong> Therapy typically aims to diagnose and treat mental health conditions or address specific psychological issues. Our service focuses solely on providing a space for emotional expression and the relief that comes from being heard.</li>
                        <li><strong>Approach:</strong> Therapists use specific clinical techniques and interventions based on their training. We use deep listening without intervention or direction.</li>
                        <li><strong>Credentials:</strong> Therapists are licensed mental health professionals. While we have training in listening practices, we are not licensed therapists.</li>
                        <li><strong>Focus:</strong> Therapy often involves working toward specific goals or changes. Our sessions have no agenda beyond creating space for you to express yourself.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Many clients use our services as a complement to therapy, while others find it meets their needs for emotional expression without requiring clinical intervention.</p>
                </div>
            </div>
            
            <div class="faq-item">
                <div class="faq-question">Is everything I share confidential?</div>
                <div class="faq-answer">
                    <p>Yes, we maintain strict confidentiality for all session content. We do not share any information from your sessions with third parties without your explicit consent.</p>
                    <p>The only exceptions to confidentiality are situations where there is:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Imminent risk of harm to yourself or others</li>
                        <li>Disclosure of abuse or neglect of a child, elderly person, or dependent adult</li>
                        <li>A court order requiring disclosure</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>In these rare situations, we would only share the minimum information necessary to ensure safety or comply with legal requirements.</p>

                <div class="faq-question">Do you offer any advice or guidance during sessions?</div>
                <div class="faq-answer">
                    <p>No, we intentionally do not offer advice or guidance during sessions. Our approach is based on the understanding that many people already have the wisdom they need within themselves—they just need space to access it.</p>
                    <p>By providing attentive listening without advice, we create an environment where you can hear your own thoughts more clearly and connect with your own inner guidance. Many clients report experiencing clarity and insights simply through the process of articulating their thoughts to someone who is fully present.</p>
                    <p>If you're specifically looking for advice, guidance, or strategies, you might be better served by a coach, consultant, or therapist.</p>

                <div class="faq-question">How do I prepare for my first session?</div>
                <div class="faq-answer">
                    <p>There's no specific preparation needed for your first session. You don't need to plan what to talk about or bring any materials. Simply:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Find a quiet, private space where you won't be interrupted</li>
                        <li>Ensure you have a stable internet connection for virtual sessions</li>
                        <li>Come as you are, with whatever is on your mind</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Some clients find it helpful to take a few minutes before the session to check in with themselves about what's present for them, but this isn't necessary. The session is yours to use however feels most supportive.</p>

                <div class="faq-question">How do I know which service is right for me?</div>
                <div class="faq-answer">
                    <p>The right service depends on your current needs and circumstances:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Listening Session (1 hour):</strong> Ideal for first-time clients, regular check-ins, or when you have a specific situation you'd like to process. This is our most popular option for new clients.</li>
                        <li><strong>Deep Listening Session (1.5 hours):</strong> Best when you're dealing with complex emotions or situations that need more time to unfold. The extra 30 minutes allows for deeper exploration.</li>
                        <li><strong>Extended Support Session (3 hours):</strong> Recommended for significant life transitions, processing trauma, or when you need comprehensive emotional support. Includes breaks as needed.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>If you're unsure, we recommend starting with a standard Listening Session. You can always book a longer session next time if you find you need more space.</p>

                <div class="faq-answer">
                    <p>We understand that life happens and sometimes plans need to change. Our rescheduling policy is:</p>
                    <ul>

                    <p>When you book a session, you'll receive a secure link to join your virtual session at the scheduled time. All you need is a device with internet access, a camera, and a microphone.</p>
                    <p>We use Google Meet for all sessions, which provides end-to-end encryption for your privacy and security.</p>
